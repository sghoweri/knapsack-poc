Bootstrap's card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
           
#### Example Usage

```html
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <img src="..." class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Content Types

##### Body
The building block of a card is the `.card-body`. Use it whenever you need a padded section within a card.

##### Titles
Card titles are used by adding `.card-title` to a <h*> tag. In the same way, links are added and placed next to each other by adding `.card-link` to an <a> tag.

##### Subtitles
Subtitles are used by adding a `.card-subtitle` to a <h*> tag. If the .card-title and the `.card-subtitle` items are placed in a `.card-body` item, the card title and subtitle are aligned nicely.

##### Images
`.card-img-top` places an image to the top of the card. With `.card-text`, text can be added to the card. Text within `.card-text` can also be styled with the standard HTML tags.

##### List Groups
`.list-group` creates lists of content in a card with a flush list group.
              
##### Card Headers
Card headers can be styled by adding `.card-header` to <h*> elements.
