#### Usage

Due to the widespread use of tables across third-party widgets like calendars and date pickers, we’ve designed our tables to be opt-in. Just add the base class .table to any `<table>`, then extend with custom styles or our various included modifier classes.

Nested tables will be styled in the same manner as the parent.

#### Colors

You can invert the colors—with light text on dark backgrounds—with `.table-dark`.

Use contextual classes to color individual table rows.

#### THead Colors

Similar to tables and dark tables, use the modifier classes `.thead-light` or `.thead-dark` to make `<thead>`s appear light or dark gray.

#### Striped Rows

Use `.table-striped` to add zebra-striping to any table row within the `<tbody>`.

#### Borders

Add `.table-bordered` for borders on all sides of the table and cells.

#### Hoverable

Add `.table-hover` to enable a hover state on table rows within a `<tbody>`.

#### Captions

A `<caption>` functions like a heading for a table. It helps users with screen readers to find a table and understand what it’s about and decide if they want to read it.
