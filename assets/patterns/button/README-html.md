Bootstrap includes several predefined button styles, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control.

#### Example Usage

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
```

> Note: Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
    Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies â€“ such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the .sr-only class.
    
#### Button Tags

The `.btn` classes are designed to be used with the `<button>` element. However, you can also use these classes on `<a>` or `<input>` elements (though some browsers may apply a slightly different rendering).

When using button classes on `<a>` elements that are used to trigger in-page functionality (like collapsing content), rather than linking to new pages or sections within the current page, these links should be given a role="button" to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as screen readers.

#### Outline buttons

In need of a button, but not the hefty background colors they bring? Replace the default modifier classes with the `.btn-outline-*` ones to remove all background images and colors on any button.

#### Sizes

Fancy larger or smaller buttons? Add `.btn-lg` or `.btn-sm` for additional sizes.
