#### Usage

The most basic list group is an unordered list with list items and the proper classes. Build upon it with the options that follow, or with your own CSS as needed.

##### Active Items

Add `.active` to a `.list-group-item` to indicate the current active selection.

#### Disabled Items

Add `.disabled` to a `.list-group-item` to make it appear disabled. Note that some elements with `.disabled` will also require custom JavaScript to fully disable their click events (e.g., links).

#### Flush

Add `.list-group-flush` to remove some borders and rounded corners to render list group items edge-to-edge in a parent container (e.g., cards).

#### Context

Use contextual classes to style list items with a stateful background and color.

Contextual classes also work with `.list-group-item-action`. Note the addition of the hover styles here not present in the previous example. Also supported is the `.active` state; apply it to indicate an active selection on a contextual list group item.
