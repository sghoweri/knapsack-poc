#### Usage

Only two classes are requiredâ€”the wrapping `.media` and the `.media-body` around your content. Optional padding and margin can be controlled through spacing utilities.


#### Nesting

Media objects can be infinitely nested, though we suggest you stop at some point. Place nested `.media` within the `.media-body` of a parent media object.

#### Alignment

Media in a media object can be aligned with flexbox utilities to the top (default), middle, or end of your `.media-body` content.

#### List

Because the media object has so few structural requirements, you can also use these classes on list HTML elements. On your `<ul>` or `<ol>`, add the `.list-unstyled` to remove any browser default list styles, and then apply `.media` to your `<li>`s. As always, use spacing utilities wherever needed to fine tune.
